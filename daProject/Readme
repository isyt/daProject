COMPILING THE CODE:
==================
In the folder containing source file and Makefile , type "make"
OR
type: "g++ -o ps.out main.c -I."

EXECUTING THE CODE:
==================
Example 1: EACG21
"./Pai_Syed.out  EACG21.net EACG21.are"
Three output files are created:
-ps_Placement_summary_EACG21.txt : Contains concise summary for the benchmark,including execution time
-ps_Placement_EACG21.txt : Stores placement co-ordinates along with cell names
-ps_matlab_EACG21.txt : Stores placement co-ordinates only - To be used as inout for matlab script


Example2: ibm01
"./ps.out ibm01.net ibm01.are"
Output files:
-ps_Placement_summary_ibm01.txt
-ps_Placement_ibm01.txt
-ps_matlab_ibm01.txt


EXECUTING MATLAB SCRIPT:
========================
-Load the matlab script "placement.m"
-When the script is run , it opens the browser window to ask for the input file.
-Load the file named ps_matlab_<benchmark>.txt
-The script displays the standard cells placed in a row
